# 💫 About Me:
I’m a results-driven Frontend Developer specializing in React.js and modern JavaScript, with hands-on experience building scalable, high-performance web applications and admin dashboards. I actively work on frontend–backend integrations using REST APIs with Django and Spring Boot, focusing on clean architecture, reusable components, and responsive UI design. I enjoy solving complex UI problems, implementing features like pagination, filters, role-based access, multilingual (i18n) and RTL support, and optimizing performance for large-scale applications. Currently, I’m deepening my knowledge of advanced React patterns, TypeScript, and system design fundamentals while continuously improving code quality and user experience. I’m open to collaborating on impactful projects, contributing to open-source, and building products that are scalable, accessible, and user-focused.
